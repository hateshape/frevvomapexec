# frevvomapexec
frevvomapexec is a script to verify the existence of a blind SQL injection vulnerability by injecting a delay of your choosing in seconds in Square 9 GlobalForms 6.2 and is the exploit for CVE-2018-8820. To verify the vulnerability is legitimate, the end user will be required to do math (e.g. Subtracting the smaller number from the bigger number in seconds). If that math value aligns approximately with the parameter specified with (-s) you are the proud new owner of a SQL injection. Also, use SQLmap. It is your friend. Also, remember this is an authenticated SQL injection! But do not dispair oftentimes the server will still have default credentials enabled! By default freevomapexec uses the default credentials so oftentimes all is well!
